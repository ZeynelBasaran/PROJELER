        <p>The person leading the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S. Centers
            for
            Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her family for a possible pandemic that could cause
            “severe” disruption to everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close, and social
            gatherings are discouraged.</p>
        <p>“I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning,” Messonnier said today in a conference call
            with reporters. “And I told my children that while I didn’t think that they were at risk right now, we as
            family need to be preparing for significant disruption to our lives.”</p>
        <p>Messonnier, who directs the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, sounded the most
            concerning tone yet that <a href="#">COVID-19</a>, as the disease is called, will likely become a pandemic.
            “The fact that
            this virus has caused illness and death, along with sustained person-to-person spread is concerning,” she
            said. It meets two of the criteria for a pandemic. Meanwhile, she said, “the world moves closer to meeting
            the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus.”</p>
        <blockquote class="gray">“We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that their lives
            will be
            disrupted because of this pandemic.”</blockquote>
        <p>That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that appear without a known source of
            exposure — are now occurring in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.
        </p>
        <p>“Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,” Messonnier said. It’s no longer a
            question of if, she says, but when and how many people will become severely ill.</p>
